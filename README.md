# Today-I-Leared (TIL)

Documenting software-things I learn almost everyday.
Inspired by 
[jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

##### How This Will Be Organized

Start simpleâ€“one `README.md` (this one) for all entries.
There will be no categorization yet
because I am just getting started
and want to mitigate the friction and frills.
